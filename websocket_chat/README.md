# 3xImplementation: WebSocket Chat Application

**Note: Architectures illustrated are for educational purposes ONLY. They do no necessarily follow best practices and are NOT suitable for production.**

## Notes
- [ ] HTTP endpoint for WebSocket API in API Gateway: Integration requests have to be set up to deliver the `connectionId` to the backend endpoint
- [ ] Callback URL for WebSocket API must be configured for the Go SDK using an EndpointResolver
